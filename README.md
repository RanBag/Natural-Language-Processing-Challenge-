_Machine Learning Model Comparison for Text Classification Project 



_Project Overview
_This project compares different machine learning models for text classification, evaluating their performance using various metrics. The goal is to determine the best-performing model to distinguishes between the Fake and Real Data.

__Features
Load and preprocess the dataset
Train multiple classification models
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
Compare model results
Save validation predictions for further analysis

__Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

__Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled text data used for training and validation. 
The preprocessing step includes text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.

__Model Training
Uses deep learning models for Text classification.
Implements training, validation, and testing processes.


__Results
Displays accuracy and evaluation metrics.
