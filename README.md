### Machine Learning Model Comparison for Text Classification Project 








### Project Overview

This project compares different machine learning models for text classification, evaluating their performance using various metrics. The goal is to determine the best-performing model to distinguishes between the Fake and Real Data.

Features

Load and preprocess the dataset
Train multiple classification models
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
Compare model results
Save validation predictions for further analysis

Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled text data used for training and validation. 
The preprocessing step includes text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.

Model Training

Uses deep learning models for Text classification.
Implements training, validation, and testing processes.


Results

Displays accuracy and evaluation metrics.
